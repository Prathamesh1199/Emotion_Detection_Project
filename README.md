# Emotion Detection Project

This project aims to classify emotions using the FER2013 dataset. The focus was on enhancing model robustness and accuracy through strategic handling of class imbalance and optimization of custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models.

## Key Features

- **Class Imbalance Handling**: 
  - Enhanced model performance by addressing class imbalance in the FER2013 dataset using strategic image augmentation and class weights. This approach led to a 30% improvement in overall model performance.

- **Model Development and Optimization**:
  - Developed and optimized custom CNN models, including VGG16 and ResNet50v2 architectures, to achieve better emotion classification results.

- **Accuracy and Metrics**:
  - Achieved 66% accuracy in emotion classification with detailed precision, recall, and F1‐scores across 7 emotion labels.

- **Real-time Emotion Detection**:
  - Introduced the model for real‐time emotion detection in live video streams using Gradio and OpenCV.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for the project.
- **TensorFlow & Keras**: Frameworks used for building and training CNN models.
- **OpenCV**: Used for real-time video processing.
- **Gradio**: Interface for real-time emotion detection in live video streams.
